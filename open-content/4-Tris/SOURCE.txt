The 4-Tris source code is divided into a small handful of files:

    4-tris.asm          -- Contains all of the executable program code .
    font.asm            -- Contains the GRAM definitions for 4-Tris.
    nut1mrch.asm        -- Nutcracker "March" music data.
    chindnce.asm        -- Nutcracker "Chinese Dance" music data.
    behappy.asm         -- "Don't Worry, Be Happy" music data.

This file mostly focuses on the general design of the 4-Tris game, and
not on the file formats for the font or music data.  These are documented
in the 4-Tris source code itself.

Note that this document kinda rambles at points and isn't as structured
as I would like.  I currently have the flu and I'm not thinking 100% 
clearly.  Nonetheless, I hope you find this useful.

 Initialization
----------------

The program is initialized in two steps.  

The first step preempts the EXEC's initialization by using the "Special
Title Screen" bit in the cartridge ROM header.  This causes the EXEC
to jump to our Initialization code that's immediately after the title
string.  This code performs some minor, basic tasks, such as clearing 
memory and trying to randomize the random number generator's seed.  It 
then sets our Interrupt Service Routine's address to point to the main 
initialization code, and spins waiting for an interrupt.

The main initialization code is called via the vertical retrace interrupt.
The reason this was done was so that the initialization routine could
safely write to the GRAM and STIC control registers.  By running our
initialization from an interrupt handler, we can be sure to have access
to the STIC, GRAM, and GROM for as long as we need.

The GRAM, GROM, and STIC are only accessible for approximately 2100 cycles 
after a vertical retrace interrupt (I haven't measured this -- this is a 
rough guess) under normal circumstances.  In normal play, programs are
expected to access the GRAM and STIC registers during the short vertical
retrace window, and then hit the "STIC handshake" register (location $0020)
to let the STIC know it's safe to display a frame.  However, these can be 
accessed for longer if the program does not hit the "STIC handshake".  The
display merely blanks.

Anyway, the main initialization code copies the GROM font over to GRAM
to give us a nice default.  (This allows us to occasionally use pastels
in color-stack mode for text.  See the 'Sound Test' screen for an example.)
Then, after the GROM font is copied to GRAM, we unpack 4-Tris' special 
font replacements overtop of the default font.  It does this, as well as
some other minor initialization steps, with interrupts disabled so that
we are sure to get a clean GRAM/STIC setup.

These are the other initialization steps that are performed:  

 -- Resets the stack pointer to $2F0.

 -- Verifies random number seed is non-zero.  (A zero in the seed
    causes the random number generator to generate zeros only!)

 -- Stubs out the "PREVBL" task ... the game will set this later.

 -- Sets our interrupt handler to the game's Main ISR.


Once the initialization is complete, the game falls into the main 
state-machine loop.  (Note that the INIT function never returns.)


-----------------------------------------
 Overall Game Structure:  The Task Model
-----------------------------------------

The game is structured as a set of tasks that are triggered either by
events or by timers which expire.  All tasks are queued when they
are ready to run, and are serviced from an asynchronous "Main Loop".
The "Main Loop" pulls tasks from the queue as they arrive, and calls
them one at a time.  Optional "instance data" may be provided when
a task is queued, and that data is provided in register R2.

The system itself consists of a mixture of periodic, semi-periodic,
one-shot, and event-spawned tasks.  The first three, periodic, 
semi-periodic, and one-shot, are scheduled by task counters that are 
maintained in the game's Main ISR.  A separate task record is kept in 
16-bit memory for each task that is timer oriented.  You can think
of these tasks as being "synchronously scheduled".

Event-spawned tasks are placed in the queue whenever some function in
the game detects that a task needs to be spawned to handle the event.
For instance, controller inputs result in a small task being queued
to dispatch to the correct handler.  Also, the special "Exit" task
(which is queued by the function SCHEDEXIT) is queued in this manner,
although it causes the Main Loop to exit.

Synchronously scheduled tasks in 4-Tris include the task which animates 
the title banner, the task which updates the player's score display, 
and the task which causes piece to fall.  Asynchronous tasks include 
controller input dispatches, the scoring routines, and the task which 
updates the # of lines and level number.

Synchronously scheduled tasks can be either 'periodic' or 'one-shot'.
Periodic tasks are useful for tasks that need to run with a certain
frequency.  This includes the score update (which 'rolls' towards the 
player's actual score), as well as the 'artificial gravity' that makes 
pieces fall.  One-shot tasks are useful when a particular task needs to 
be run after a certain delay, but is only run once.  In-between these
two are self-retriggering tasks, which are started as 'One-shot' tasks,
but which retrigger themselves if they determine that they need to
run an additional time.  The line-clear routine in DOSCORE is such a
task.


-------------------------------
 The Interrupt Service Routine
-------------------------------

The main Interrupt Service Routine is the glue which holds the game 
together.  It performs several tasks which are necessary to keep the
game going:

 -- Run any miscellaneous "pre-VBLANK" task requested by main program.
 -- Hit the vertical blank handshake to keep screen enabled.
 -- Update any active sound streams.
 -- Drain and pixels queued up in the Pixel Queue.
 -- Count down task timers and schedule tasks when timers expire.
 -- Count down the 'busy-wait' timer if it is set.
 -- Detect a "Pause" request and pause the game if needed.

Let's take these one at a time:

 -- Run any miscellaneous "pre-VBLANK" task requested by main program.

If the main program needs to update any STIC registers or GRAM contents,
it can do so by setting up a function in the pointer "PREVBL".  This is
called first-thing on entering the ISR.  Currently, 4-Tris installs a
simple routine which manages the color stack, and that's it.

 -- Hit the vertical blank handshake to keep screen enabled.

Once all STIC and GRAM accesses are out of the way, we hit the STIC 
handshake to ensure that the display stays enabled.  If we don't do
this, the display will blank.

 -- Update any active sound streams.

This is where sound effects and music are updated.  We make multiple
calls to "DOSNDSTREAM" to update both music and sound effects.  Both
are encoded identically.  If the 4-Tris well is overly full, we call
the music update twice, to make the music go double-speed.  I'll discuss
the music architecture later.

 -- Drain and pixels queued up in the Pixel Queue. 

In order to prevent flicker when pieces are redrawn, I've implemented a
"pixel queue" which queues up put-pixel requests for drawing the pieces.
I empty this queue from the ISR, so that (hopefully) I beat the display
refresh and avoid flicker.  Apparently, I've succeeded, according to
Doug Parsons.  

I didn't place the pixel queue routines in the Pre-VBlank routine for a 
couple reasons.  First, they're slow.  Slow enough that it could cause 
the display to blank in some cases if enough pixels were queued.  Second,
the Pre-VBlank routine is called before the sound update, and the 
pixel queue depth could vary widely.  This could affect sound quality.
Third, if the piece does flicker a little (maybe possible at top of
screen), it's non-fatal -- just a nuisance.

 -- Count down task timers and schedule tasks when timers expire.

This is where the synchronously scheduled tasks are scheduled.  I loop
through all of the active tasks and count down their timers.  If a timer
expires, I restart it (unless it's a one-shot task), and I queue the
task's function pointer and instance data in the task queue.  If the
task queue overflows, right now I drop the task.  (I haven't had any
problem with task-queue overflows, though.)

 -- Count down the 'busy-wait' timer if it is set.

The main program can call the "WAIT" function to wait for a certain
number of 60Hz ticks.  The ISR is responsible for counting down this
timer.  Waiting for a single tick (wait duration of '1') is a good way 
to sync up with the ISR, say, if you're waiting for queued pixels to
be drawn.

 -- Detect a "Pause" request and pause the game if needed.

Finally, there's the infamous 'Pause' key sequence.  We implement this
in the ISR, since we treat Pause as an event that preempts the entire
game.  If Pause is detected, the Pause code mutes the audio by zeroing
volume registers (and saving the old volume register contents from the 
PSG), and then busywaits until the player's request an un-pause.  The
"wait for unpause" looks about like so:

     -- Wait for both controller pads to be un-pressed.
     -- Wait for either controller pad to be pressed
     -- Wait for both controller pads to be un-pressed.

This was done to make pausing clean and reliable, and not glitchy.

------------------
 The Music Engine
------------------

A more complete description of the music format is given in the 4-Tris
source code.  This mainly discusses how sound and music are interleaved
together.

4-Tris' sound engine is a "microprogrammed" sound engine, in that the
data stream consists primarly of commands of the form "write this value
to that register."  While this is extremely expressive, it's a pain to
work with, and not really very flexible.  But, given my limited time 
frame, I was able to achieve some impressive results nonetheless.

4-Tris is configured to have two active sound streams.  One sound 
stream is dedicated to background music, and the other is dedicated
to sound effects.  Each sound streamm is given access to certain
registers on the PSG.  This is controlled via a bitmask stored in the
sound stream's status record.

The sound effects in 4-Tris vary in their complexity.  For instance, 
the most common sound effects, the piece-movement 'Bip', the piece
placement 'BYump', and the line-clearing laser blast all require only
a single PSG channel to play.  In contrast, the rarer sound effects,
such as the 'Cleared Four Lines' gong, and the level-change 'Three 
Dings' require more PSG channels.  This means that the sound effect
stream is going to need access to a varying number of sound channels.

One approach would be to just allocate the maximum number of sound 
channels that a sound effect needs to the sound effect stream, and 
leave it at that.  However, some sound effects use the _entire_
PSG.  The compromise position would be to lessen the richness of
the sound effect and/or music.  Obviously, this won't work.

The 4-Tris music engine solves this by the following technique.  First,
it allocates the entire PSG to the Music stream, since Music is generally
playing all of the time.  Then, when a sound effect comes active, it
'borrows' as many PSG resources as it needs from the Music stream, but
only during the duration of the sound effect.  This borrowing is
controlled by the routine "SNDPRIO".

SNDPRIO looks to see if there is a sound effect active.  If so, it
looks at its "Stream Channel Mask", which is a 14-bit word that says
which registers that stream can write to.  It complements that word
within the lower 14 bits (it XORs with $3FFF), and stores this out
as the Music's "Stream Channel Mask".  (Actually, there's one additional
step:  If the Music is muted, then the Music's stream channel mask is
ANDed with $7FF to prevent the Music stream from writing to the volume
registers.)  The SNDPRIO routine is called before updating the sound 
streams.

This method works, but is prone to glitches.  In order for this 
technique to work reliably, music data that expects to be preempted by 
sound effects should send frequent volume updates as well as both halves 
of the period registers when updating notes.  Otherwise, strange things 
can happen when stray values are left in registers that were borrowed for 
a sound-effect.

On a different subject, we have sound effect priorities.  Since we have
only one sound effect stream, we can only play one sound effect at a time.
The 4-Tris music engine implements sound effect priorities to solve
this.  Whenever a sound effect is triggered, the music code first sees
if a higher priority sound effect is already playing.  If it isn't,
it plays the requested sound effect.  Otherwise, the sound effect is 
dropped.  This keeps weird things from happening, such as the "BIP" 
overriding the "Change of Level" sound effect.

Sound effects and music streams are played by calling the PLAY.sfx
and PLAY.mus functions.
